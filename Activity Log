# Activity Log – Day 1

## Objective
Deploy a local SIEM using Wazuh and establish basic management access.

---

## Work Completed

- Installed Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS as a KVM virtual machine
- Configured libvirt / virt-manager for VM management
- Enabled and validated SSH access to the VM
- Installed Wazuh all-in-one stack:
  - Wazuh Manager
  - Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch)
  - Wazuh Dashboard
- Verified all Wazuh services were running via `systemctl`
- Accessed the Wazuh dashboard via web browser

---

## Issues Encountered

### Clipboard Not Working in VM Console
- **Cause:** TTY-based VM console limitations
- **Resolution:** Switched to SSH-based management

### Dashboard Login Failures
- **Cause:** Admin credentials not synchronized with OpenSearch security backend
- **Resolution:** Reset credentials using Wazuh CLI tools

### RBAC / Permission Errors
- **Cause:** User not mapped to required OpenSearch roles
- **Resolution:** Corrected role mappings to allow index access

### SSH Access Failing from Laptop
- **Cause:** VM was using libvirt NAT networking (`192.168.122.0/24`)
- **Resolution:** Identified need for bridged networking to allow LAN access

### Agent Installed on Manager
- **Cause:** Confusion between manager and agent roles
- **Resolution:** Removed agent package and restored manager-only configuration

---

## Current State (End of Day)

- Wazuh SIEM stack installed and operational
- Dashboard accessible locally
- RBAC issues resolved
- SSH access confirmed from host
- Network still NAT-isolated (planned change)

---

## Lessons Learned

- Many SIEM issues stem from authentication and permissions rather than software bugs
- Network topology must be validated early
- SSH access is critical for effective troubleshooting
- Clear separation of manager and agent roles is essential
