# Home Net Secure Monitor

A hands-on home SOC lab focused on learning and practicing real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows using open-source security tooling.

This repository documents the **actual build, troubleshooting, and operation** of a local SIEM environment, with an emphasis on endpoint monitoring, alert generation, and investigation rather than theoretical setup guides.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Deploy and operate a local SIEM (Wazuh)
- Monitor real endpoints on a home network
- Practice SOC-relevant troubleshooting and analysis
- Document work in a transparent, version-controlled manner
- Build practical experience applicable to SOC analyst roles

This is an **ongoing lab**, maintained as a working journal rather than a polished tutorial.
